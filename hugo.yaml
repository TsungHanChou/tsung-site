    content: |-
      My name is Tsung-Han Chou (周宗翰). I am an incoming PhD student in Business Administration and Management at Bocconi University, set to begin in September 2025. My research interests lie in innovation economics and industrial organization, focusing on understanding how technology evolves and how policies shape innovation trajectories. Recently, I have worked on applying natural language processing (NLP) and large language models (LLMs) to analyze trademark data, aiming to trace the emergence and diffusion of product and service inventions over time. This work reflects my broader interest in leveraging computational tools to study innovation patterns and their economic implications.

      My previous work has explored licensing strategies, environmental policy, and successive monopolies. These efforts have led to publications in the *Review of Industrial Organization* and the *Journal of Economics*.
